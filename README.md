# Housing-Prices-Regression-EDA and Model Evaluation

This project analyzes and predicts house prices using a regression approach. It includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and evaluation steps. The dataset used is the popular Kaggle House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques dataset.

Project Structure
EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis):

Overview of missing values, feature distributions, correlations, and outliers.

Visualization of numeric and categorical features.

Data Preprocessing:

Handling missing data.

Encoding categorical variables.

Feature scaling and transformation.

Modeling:

Training multiple regression models.

Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.

Performance evaluation using RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error).

Evaluation:

Comparison of model performance.

Selection of the best performing model.
